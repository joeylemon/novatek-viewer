# Novatek Dashcam Footage Viewer with GPS Information

This Electron-based desktop application provides a free and open-source way to view Novatek-based dashcam video files alongside realtime GPS information.

## Motivation

Novatek-based dashcams save GPS-encoded video files in a non-standard format, forcing users to use clunky or paid applications to view their footage alongside the GPS information. Viofo's officially recommended application for viewing the GPS information is https://dashcamviewer.com/, which costs between $35-$75 dollars depending on the version. This repository aims to provide a free application that matches or exceeds the quality of alternate viewers on the internet, prioritizing the user interface with a modern design and the user experience with ease-of-use.
